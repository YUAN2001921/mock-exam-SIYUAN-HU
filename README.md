## Project Overview
This repository contains my work for the *Mock Exam* assessment in the Programming Fundamentals unit.  
The project implements a **Command-Line Quiz Generator** that:
- Loads question and answer pairs from a text file  
- Asks the user to specify how many questions to attempt  
- Randomly selects unique questions  
- Quizzes the user through the terminal  
- Calculates and displays the final score  

All code and pseudocode are written using only techniques taught **up to Week 10** of this semester.

## File Structure
mock-exam-siyuanhu/
├─ Mock_Exam.ipynb # Main notebook with all exam sections
├─ conversation_log.txt # Record of all AI prompts and responses
├─ sample_quiz.txt # Question/answer file used by the quiz
└─ README.md # This document

## Course Constraints (Week References)
- **Week 2:** Lists, strings, algorithm planning (6-step methodology)  
- **Week 6:** Basic file reading, input validation, error handling  
- **Week 7:** Simple random selection without duplicates  
- **Week 10:** Function design and modularisation  

No advanced features beyond Week 10 (e.g., external libraries, object-oriented design, or APIs) are used.

## How to Run
1. Open the repository in Google Colab or VS Code.  
2. Ensure the file `sample_quiz.txt` is located in the same directory as the notebook.  
3. Run all cells in `Mock_Exam.ipynb`.  
4. Follow on-screen prompts to complete the quiz.

## Academic Integrity Statement
All content in this repository is written by **Siyuan Hu** and developed using AI assistance in accordance with the Curtin University guidelines.  
All AI interactions are documented in `conversation_log.txt` and limited to techniques covered in the course.

## Course Reference
Planning and development follow the **Week 2 Computational Thinking & Algorithm Design** methodology,  
and implementation uses **Weeks 2, 6, and 7** concepts taught in the unit.
