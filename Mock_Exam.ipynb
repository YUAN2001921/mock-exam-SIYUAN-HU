The program should load question and answer pairs from a text file, let the user choose how many questions to attempt, randomly pick that number of unique questions, ask each question in the terminal, and then show the final score. It must use only techniques covered up to Week 10, such as basic file reading and input validation from Week 6, list handling from Week 2, and simple random selection from Week 7. Please provide clear pseudocode following the six-step planning process taught in Week 2: understanding the problem, defining inputs and outputs, working through an example, writing pseudocode, implementing, and testing.\n",

        "The two refinements systematically strengthened the design while staying within course scope. Guided by the Week 2 six-step planning method, I first addressed robustness: using Week 6 techniques, the pseudocode now validates the file path, skips malformed lines, and bounds the question count with simple input checks, preventing common failures without adding advanced constructs. Next, I improved fairness and UX by applying Week 7’s simple non-repeating random selection (shuffle indices, take first N) and Week 2 string/list handling to normalise answers (trim + lower). I also introduced a Week 3 text-based menu to structure choices and provide optional score viewing. Together, these changes yield a clear, testable flow that is modular, easy to implement, and aligned with the “≤ Week 10” constraint."

In Week 6: File Operations and Input Validation, we learned how to verify file paths, handle missing files gracefully, and prevent the program from crashing when a user provides invalid input. Building on this, Week 7: Iteration and Data Processing taught us how to clean datasets using loops, validate column presence, and apply simple numeric operations to calculate statistics such as averages or pass rates. Finally, in Week 8: Exception Handling Fundamentals, we learned to use layered try/except structures to separate predictable file-related issues from unexpected runtime errors, allowing for user-friendly feedback and smoother program execution. Through combining these weekly topics, we demonstrated an integrated understanding of safe file handling, structured data validation, and basic error management within the Week 10 course boundaries."

        "We implemented these functions by combining Week 2 (Lists and Strings) for storing (question, answer) pairs and normalising input, Week 5 (Iteration and Decision Making) for looping through items and comparing answers, Week 6 (File I/O and Basic Validation) for safe file reading with beginner-friendly error messages, and Week 7 (Simple Random Selection) for non-repeating sampling via shuffled indices. Each choice reflects our Section 1 pseudocode and the course’s AI-partnership guidance: AI provided only syntax reminders, while we authored the control logic manually. The overall solution remains strictly within the ≤ Week 10 scope and mirrors the straightforward, functional style used in our weekly exercises."

        "I followed the Artificial Intelligence Partnership Guidelines by restricting the model’s suggestions to topics taught before Week Ten. When the artificial intelligence recommended advanced functions or external libraries, I simplified its ideas using the methods from Week Six File Operations and Validation and Week Five Loops and Conditionals. For instance, in the function, I replaced complex syntax with the basic statement and simple and handling to keep the program consistent with beginner-level practice.load_quiz_questionswith open()tryexcept\n",

From Week Six File Handling and Input Checking, I applied validation techniques to ensure the quiz file existed and followed the “Question|Answer” format. The concept of preventing runtime errors through input validation and user-friendly error messages was especially helpful. It reminded me how clear, defensive programming supports accurate results and smoother user interaction.\n",

        "Before the final examination, I plan to deepen my knowledge of Week Eight Exception Handling Fundamentals by writing clearer and more specific error messages for different runtime situations. I will also improve my doctest writing from Week Four Function Design to include edge cases such as empty files or invalid question lines. These steps will help me produce more reliable and maintainable programs in future assessments."
