The program should load question and answer pairs from a text file, let the user choose how many questions to attempt, randomly pick that number of unique questions, ask each question in the terminal, and then show the final score. It must use only techniques covered up to Week 10, such as basic file reading and input validation from Week 6, list handling from Week 2, and simple random selection from Week 7. Please provide clear pseudocode following the six-step planning process taught in Week 2: understanding the problem, defining inputs and outputs, working through an example, writing pseudocode, implementing, and testing.\n",

        "The two refinements systematically strengthened the design while staying within course scope. Guided by the Week 2 six-step planning method, I first addressed robustness: using Week 6 techniques, the pseudocode now validates the file path, skips malformed lines, and bounds the question count with simple input checks, preventing common failures without adding advanced constructs. Next, I improved fairness and UX by applying Week 7’s simple non-repeating random selection (shuffle indices, take first N) and Week 2 string/list handling to normalise answers (trim + lower). I also introduced a Week 3 text-based menu to structure choices and provide optional score viewing. Together, these changes yield a clear, testable flow that is modular, easy to implement, and aligned with the “≤ Week 10” constraint."
